# shopping-cart-react-typescript
This is a shopping cart that I made with React using libraries such as React router, React BootStrap. This React project is made with TypeScript. 

It is a functional shopping cart with 4 items available to choose. You can add items to the cart and delete cart items. The total tab will display all the items in the cart and the total amount.
